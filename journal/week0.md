### Installing the AWS CLI

Set up in the [Gitpod config](https://github.com/lightweavr/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/.gitpod.yml), including setting up the AWS CLI autocomplete support and making it work with the Gitpod prebuilds.

Notes:

* followed the [AWS CLI docs that specify the install location](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions) to install the CLI under `/workspace` so it persists
* followed the [AWS CLI docs to setup tab completion within Bash](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-completion.html#cli-command-completion-linux)
* bonus: `PATH` manipulation + `clear`-ing the output so the terminal is clean on workspace start and the AWS cli is usable despite being installed in a non-standard location

### Create a Billing Alarm

I'm using an AWS Organizations setup, so I created the alarm in my parent account. Except I created the alarm back in 2018, so I'm just showing the output here.

Note: I needed to use `--region us-east-1` as a parameter to the cloudwatch alarms because I'm using cloudshell in `us-west-2`, but the billing stuff is in `us-east-1` only, and cloudwatch doesn't replicate alarm information.

```json
$ aws organizations describe-account --account-id 017145807427
{
    "Account": {
        "Id": "017145807427",

### Create a Budget

Have two budgets: Zero spend and a $5/month budget

## Challenges

### Block most EC2 instance types

Since I'm using AWS Organizations, I added an SCP policy to block most EC2 instance types from being launched, since that seems to be the primary target for leaked credentials - running EC2 instances for crypto mining.

I chose C5 at random, and T4 because t4g.small instances [have 750 hours free each month until Dec 31 2023](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#t4g-instances).

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyAnyButC5OrT4",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:RunInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotLikeIfExists": {
          "ec2:InstanceType": [
            "c5*",
            "t4*"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

There was a lot of trial and error, which wasn't helped by the EC2 API returned an encoded failure message. I used `aws sts decode-authorization-message --encoded-message <message> | jq '.DecodedMessage | fromjson | .'` to understand the underlying errors, `jq` being necessary because the failure message had serialized JSON as a field, `\n`s and all.

I suspect there might be a bug with the way something in the stack is applying the `StringNotLikeIfExists` condition - the [conditions documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html#Conditions_IfExists) states that the action won't be denied if the condition doesn't exist. The deny message stated the offending resource was `"resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:017145807427:network-interface/*"`, which didn't have the condition `ec2:InstanceType`, so I'm not sure how the explicit deny was triggered.

If I changed the SCP to StringLikeIfExists, the failing resource became `"resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:017145807427:instance/*",` so I worked around the maybe-bug by setting the resource to `"arn:aws:ec2*:*:instance/*"`, skipping the network interface weirdness.

The good news is the SCP also applied to requesting a Spot Instance - the simple spec creation path actually failed because the SCP blocked launching an m6, and the Spot API seemed be consider a single failure as the entire thing failing. I had to manually specify instance types to get it to work.

I'm not sure if it'll impact ECS EC2 containers, or Fargate launches, but I'll find out.

### Block accounts from leaving the AWS Organization

I also added the ["Block leaving org"](https://github.com/hashishrajan/aws-scp-best-practice-policies/blob/main/AWS%20SCP%20Policies/Prevent%20Leave%20Organization.json) policy (from the security video), which broke my account because I detached the `FullAWSAccess` policy and attached the policy blocking leaving Organizations.

Detaching the `FullAWSAccess` policy flipped the account into an [allowlist setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_strategies.html#orgs_policies_allowlist), but the only policy attached was blocking leaving the organization, so I ended up with an account that had no permissions.

I ended up attaching both the `FullAWSAccess` and the block leaving org policies, and [used the IAM policy simulator](https://policysim.aws.amazon.com/home/index.jsp) to determine that even with "Full Access", leaving the org was still blocked.

## Random bits

* AWS Calculator assumes 1 month = 730 hours, because that's somewhat close to 30.5 days worth of hours, and is an "average" month?
* Was Andrew thinking about the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) when talking about why the AWS CLI used `/usr/local/bin`?
